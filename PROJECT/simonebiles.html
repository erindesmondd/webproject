<p>Simone Biles recently took home the Olympic gold in the womens all around competition in Rio Brazil. Along with the gold in the all around, she also took home gold in floor exercise and vault. She was a part of the iconic "final five" team as they were the last U.S. Womens Gymnastics Team that was composed of 5 members. She competed alongside Aly Raisman, Madison Kocian, Laurie Hernandez, and Gabby Douglas, who as a team took home the Womens Gymnastics Team Gold Medal. She has inspired so many gymnastics to keep trying no matter what, as she is currently training to make a comeback in the 2020 Olympic Games in Toyko, Japan.</p>
