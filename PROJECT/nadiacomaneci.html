<p class="text2"> Nadia Comaneci, a Romanian Olympic gymnast, became the first gymnast to ever be rewarded a 10.0. Comaneci achieved the highest level of accompishment a gymnast can achieve. She set the bar higher than an gymnast ever had. She set this record in 1976 at the Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada. She is an inspiration to young gymnasts around the world and to many that hope to achieve the same amount of excellence. She exemplifies that anything is possible, even if it doesn't seem like it. She currently ranks fifth among Olympic medal leaders in women's gymnastics. </p>
